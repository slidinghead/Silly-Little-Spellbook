# Silly-Little-Spellbook

This is just a little project I wanted to do for fun.

It uses the D&D 5e SRD API (https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/) to display spell info.

Right now I'm just adding a "spell search" feature to pull up spell info but I'll probably add more to the general UI and features

TODO:
- ~~figure out exactly how much info I want to show on a search~~
- ~~display spells by class/~~subclass
- Separate class spells by level (currently sorted but not clearly)
- improve UI
- figure out how to compile a python program
